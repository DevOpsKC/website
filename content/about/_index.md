DevOps KC is a Public Benefit LLC that is dedicated to advancing, and supporting, the DevOps community in the Kansas City Metro area and beyond. We are a group of individuals who have been active in the Kansas City tech scene, as well as around the world, and have organized the DevOps KC Meetup and DevOpsDays KC.

There are many different ways to get involved:

- You’re an individual who would like to come alongside and participate in, and help grow, the DevOps community in the KC Metro area
- You’re a company or organization that is looking to support DevOps communities, as well as raising awareness of what you do
- Something else….?

Please [reach out](/contact)! We would love to have you partner with us.
